## `Movie-Buddies`

A Web App for organizing and attending movie parties.

This application aims to ease out the process of throwing causal movie parties and movie nights.
Movies in theatres are easy to locate on the internet using various movie ticket booking websites, but there is no dedicated web app for movie parties or movie get-togethers organized by friends. Our web app aims to solve this problem by providing a platform where movie buffs can create movie events like movie nights or movie parties and buy tickets for these movies event.

Our application provides a platform where anyone can register as an organizer and create movie party events and create tickets for that party. Movie buffs can login as regular users and can browse and book tickets for many movie events.
Users can also browse recent or old movies from a movie Database ([The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)) and add votes to request a movie. The organizers can access stats like most requested movies, most popular movies etc and use those insights to select a movie for showing at an event they want to create. Based on these stats they can also decide the location, the number of tickets and pricing for a future movie event that they plan to organize.
